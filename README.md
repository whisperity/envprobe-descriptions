Envprobe Variable Descriptions Community Knowledge
==================================================

This repository is a sister project for the
[**Envprobe**](http://github.com/whisperity/envprobe) tool.

The knowledgebase is aimed at collecting information about environment
variables' types, usage, description, and various other metadata.



Organisation of this repository
-------------------------------

The repository contains environment variables' descriptions in a
theme-divided fashion. Each CSV file is named aptly to represent a context
where the variable "comes from" or is applicable to. The data is stored in
these CSV files.

To obtain an actionable copy of this repository and to see the descriptions
in your command line, please install Envprobe. After install, execute

    epc update-community

After the command has finished, querying the information of a variable will
show the data collected for that variable.
