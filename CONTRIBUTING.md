Contribution guidelines
=======================


Organisation
------------

Please keep the organised fashion of the variables, and only introduce new
or merge existing categories when necessary.

The CSV file should be lexicographically sorted on the variable's name.


Style
-----

Environment variables are *usually* `FULL_CAPITAL_NAMES_WITH_UNDERSCORES`,
unless in extremely specific circumstances. Due to the case-sensitive nature
of Unix(-like) systems, this convention is to be mandated.


Pull requests
-------------

If possible, create a clear and concise *Pull Request* on top of the latest
`master` commit. In the patch's description, explain the changes, and &ndash;
if possible &ndash; provide proof. (Think of this repository like the
[GitHub collection of useful `.gitignore`s](http://github.com/github/gitignore),
but for your Shell variables.)

You can submit multiple (related) changes to the metadata in a single patch.
